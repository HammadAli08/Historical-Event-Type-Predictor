# 🧠 Historical Event Type Predictor  
**Using Machine Learning to Classify Global Events from Text**

---

## 📜 Project Overview

This project combines my passion for **history** and **machine learning**. The goal is simple yet powerful:  
**Predict the type of an event (e.g., protest, riot, movement) based solely on its description.**

By analyzing real-world historical event data, I built a classification system that helps understand the underlying patterns in how events are described — and what those descriptions imply.

## 💡 Why This Project?

As someone who loves both **analyzing data** and **studying history**, I wanted to explore how the language used in historical records can be translated into structured, predictive insights using machine learning. This project is a result of merging those two interests into one meaningful build.
